Module "PWM1"      (bean PWM)
   - PWM1_Enable -This method enables the component - it starts the signal generation. Events may be generated 
                (<DisableEvent>/<EnableEvent>).
   - PWM1_Disable -This method disables the component - it stops the signal generation and events calling. When the timer is 
                disabled, it is possible to call <ClrValue> and <SetValue> methods.
   - PWM1_SetRatio16 -This method sets a new duty-cycle ratio. Ratio is expressed as a 16-bit unsigned integer number. 0 - FFFF 
                value is proportional to ratio 0 - 100%. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined 
                values in <Starting pulse width> property.   Note: Calculated duty depends on the timer possibilities and on 
                the selected period.
   - PWM1_SetDutyUS -This method sets the new duty value of the output signal. The duty is expressed in microseconds as a 
                16-bit unsigned integer number. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined values in 
                <Starting pulse width> property.
   - PWM1_SetDutyMS -This method sets the new duty value of the output signal. The duty is expressed in milliseconds as a 
                16-bit unsigned integer number. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined values in 
                <Starting pulse width> property.

Module "Cap1"      (bean Capture)
   - Cap1_Enable -This method enables the component - it starts the capture. Events may be generated 
                (<DisableEvent>/<EnableEvent>).
   - Cap1_Disable -This method disables the component - it stops the capture. No events will be generated.
   - Cap1_EnableEvent -This method enables the events. This method is available only if any event is selected.
   - Cap1_Reset -This method resets the counter register (see implementation note in <General Info>).
   - Cap1_GetCaptureValue -This method gets the last value captured by enabled timer (see implementation note in <General Info>)
                . The method does not return valid value after initialization or after <Reset> until new capture event (even if 
                the returned Error code is ERR_OK).
   - Cap1_GetPinValue -The method reads the Capture pin value. The method is available only if it is possible to read the pin 
                value (usually not available for internal signals).

Module "Cpu"       (bean MC9S08SH8_20)
   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enables maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_DisableInt -Disables maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_Delay100US -This method realizes software delay. The length of delay is at least 100 microsecond multiply input 
                parameter [us100]. As the delay implementation is not based on real clock, the delay time may be increased by 
                interrupt service routines processed during the delay. The method is independent on selected speed mode.
